We give users the ability to easily exchange assets with friends or strangers nearby after negotiating in real life.

* Users get trustless way to trade without risk of fraud


### How it works
After negotiating the terms of the trade, the first device creates a 0x order. The second device then signs the transaction to settle the order through 0x protocol. Tokenary app uses Web3Swift.io library to communicate with an Ethereum node and sign the transaction. We also use Apple Connectivity to search for the devices nearby.
